We've successfully completed a year! In that time several PhD students have joined the lab, we've submitted many grants (good news soon!), established some great collaborations and happily settled into UF. 
Tina and Leslie are taking courses while starting up their PhD research, and Zack is making huge strides in his projects. Zack will be taking his qualifying exams very soon.
As the pandemic is still ongoing, we are still intermittently working remotely.

Kiley taught two courses this year. An undergraduate level introduction to bioinformatics and a brand new course at the graduate level, Machine Learning in Genomics.
