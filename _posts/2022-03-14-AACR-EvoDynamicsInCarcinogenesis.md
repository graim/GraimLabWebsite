We attended our first in-person conference today ([AACR Special Conference: Evolutionary Dynamics in Carcinogenesis and Response to Therapy](https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-special-conference-evolutionary-dynamics-in-carcinogenesis-and-response-to-therapy/). 
Kiley, Tina, and Leslie are in Tampa. It's been a great time and we met a lot of very cool people. Looking forward to becoming regular attendees. 
Tina also presented her first ever poster. Congrats Tina!
