Kiley presented a poster at the [AACR Annual Meeting](https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2022/), titled: Intra-patient tumor evolution analysis in dogs with many mammary tumors identifies signatures of tumor aggression in early-stage breast cancers. 
This work builds on her postdoctoral work, comparing human and dog breast cancers. Recent work focuses on the evolution of tumors across the two species and how evolutionary factors may have driven tumor development similarly in the two species.
