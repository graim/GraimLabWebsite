The Graim lab begins today. We will be recruiting undergraduate and graduate students to work in the lab, purchasing equipment, and working to get the lab set up. As the pandemic is still ongoing, we will be working remotely for the forseeable future. I'm delighted to be in Gainesville starting up this new adventure.
