# Graim's Genomics
The Graim lab develops computational tools that integrate large-scale genomic data to identify mechanisms driving human disease. 
We develop strategies for studying molecular processes that are often disguised by noisy data and low sampling rates. 
Our research facilitates learning the biological basis of these deadly diseases and, ultimately, deduces novel treatments and identifies early-stage risk factors to allow for early treatment of invasive human diseases.
