# Graim's Genomics
The Graim lab develops computational tools that integrate large-scale genomic data to identify mechanisms driving human disease, with an emphasis on cancer. 
Our models probe complex biological data to answer scientific questions arising from basic science and translational research. 
We develop strategies for studying disease initiation and progression, patient-specific therapeutic response, and hidden molecular subtypes that are often disguised by noisy data and low sampling rates. 
We leverage data from many species with molecularly similar tumors, such as dogs and mice, which provides a unique opportunity to interrogate evolutionary factors underpinning tumor development. 
Our research facilitates learning the biological basis of these deadly diseases and, ultimately, deduces novel treatments and identifies early-stage risk factors to allow for early treatment of invasive human diseases.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
A deeper understanding of the biology underlying cancer development and progression is key to achieving effective cancer cures. 
Our comparative oncology approach provides a unique opportunity to harness major advances in the rapidly developing fields of machine learning and genomics for human cancer research by identifying patterns in large-scale genomic data to learn the biological mechanisms driving cancer.
