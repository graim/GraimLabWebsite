# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research


The Graim lab develops computational genomics tools to study cancer causality and progression, patient-specific therapeutic response, and hidden molecular subtypes that are often disguised by noisy data and low sampling rates. We incorporate data from many species, allowing us to leverage significantly more data from which we discover hidden evolutionary patterns of cancer development and cellular response. Our overarching goals are to identify mechanisms of human diseases and to enable development of personalized therapies.
