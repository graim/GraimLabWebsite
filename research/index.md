# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

The Graim lab develops machine learning models that integrate diverse large-scale genomics data to address key questions in human health and disease. 
These models probe complex biological data to answer scientific questions arising from basic science and translational research. 
Our overarching goals are to identify mechanisms of human diseases and to enable development of personalized therapies.

We develop strategies for studying cancer causality and progression, patient-specific therapeutic response, and hidden molecular subtypes that are often disguised by noisy data and low sampling rates. 
We leverage data from many species, using comparative oncology approaches to analyze data from species with molecularly similar tumors, such as dogs and mice.
This allows us to build models using significantly more data for cheaper, from which we discover hidden evolutionary patterns of cancer development and cellular response.
Cross species analysis provides a unique opportunity to interrogate evolutionary factors underpinning tumor development and leverages the power of pan-species analysis to detect fundamental mechanisms of cancer.
