The Graim lab is currently recruiting undergraduate researchers, PhD students, and postdoctoral scholars. Prospective PhD students can apply through [CISE](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/graduate/phd/) or the [Genetics and Genomics](http://ufgi.ufl.edu/grad-program/) program at UF, and please also send an introductory email outlining your relevant training and what specifically interests you about the lab. Undergraduate researchers should apply through [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVRt82UDINJlIHZn858qKjeD8qR4kIAMq85jNibOfhf0Vy_g/viewform?usp=sf_link).
 
We are a collaborative lab that works closely with researchers at UF and other universities.

Remember that the PhD is a marathon, not a race. Be kind to yourself and your labmates and do good science. While academic freedom is earned by academic productivity, the Graim Lab has no expectation that students, staff, or faculty work nights or weekends. We expect everyone to respect other's choices of their work hours. This means that you can send an email late Saturday night but do not expect a response until normal working hours.
